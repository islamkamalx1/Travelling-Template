# Travelling-template

## Demo: https://islamkamalx1.github.io/Travelling-template/

It's pure HTML and CSS.

I used FlexBox and Media Queries to make it responsive to all devices.

It's about 9 sections, I used transition, transfomation, and hover about most of elements.

It's scrolling smoothy when the user click on nav items.
